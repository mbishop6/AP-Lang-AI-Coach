    title: 'The Glass Ceiling and Stereotype Threat',
    text: 'In professional settings, a "think manager, think male" bias often persists. Stereotypes associate leadership with traditionally masculine traits, placing women in a double bind: assertive women are often labeled "abrasive," while those who exhibit collaborative traits may be perceived as not "leader-like." This stereotype threat can measurably impact performance and ambition in male-dominated fields like technology and finance.'

    title: 'Mirrors and Windows: The Impact of On-Screen Representation',
    text: 'Media is a powerful force in shaping societal norms. Far too often, it portrays women in traditional or limited rolesâ€”the nurturing mother, the damsel in distress, the overly emotional professional. This lack of diverse, complex representation reinforces harmful societal biases, limits the aspirations of young girls, and influences how women are perceived and treated in their daily lives.'

    title: 'The Invisible Weight: Internalized Stereotypes',
    text: 'The impact of cultural stereotypes extends beyond external barriers; they can be internalized, leading to self-doubt and self-censorship. Furthermore, stereotypes uphold the concept of the "mental load," an often-unseen burden where women are socially conditioned to assume primary responsibility for household management and emotional labor, which can drain cognitive resources and hinder professional focus and advancement.'

export const CLAIM = "Cultural stereotypes significantly impede women's progress not only by creating external barriers in professional environments but also by shaping media portrayals and psychological pressures that limit both perceived and actual potential.";

export const EVIDENCE = "For example, in the professional world, women are frequently caught in a 'double bind' where assertive behavior is penalized as 'abrasive,' hindering their path to leadership (Source A). This is compounded by media that reinforces biases by confining women to 'traditional or limited roles,' which in turn can 'limit the aspirations of young girls' (Source B).";
